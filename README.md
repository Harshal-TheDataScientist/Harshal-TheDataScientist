- 👋 Hi, I’m @Harshal-TheDataScientist
- 👀 I’m interested in Everything and Nothing
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Data and stuff
- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her
  🧠 Me: Data scientist by profession, adventure seeker by nature. Let's explore the uncharted territories of data! 🗺️
- ⚡ Fun fact:  I analyze data for a living, which means I’m great at predicting trends but still terrible at predicting when I'll actually get a good night's sleep. 🛌📊
                As a data scientist, I’m skilled at making sense of massive datasets, but I still struggle with my own to-do list. 📋🧠
